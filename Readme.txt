The dataset and code are uploaded by Ke Li (keli@seas.harvard.edu)

To reproduce the results, you will find the data in SourceData.zip and code scripts for each figure are indicated by their names.
The code for embodied emission calculation can be found in: EORA_EDGAR_emission_decomposition.R
The code for network analysis can be found in: Trade_network_analysis.R

To run the code, the scripts with *.ncl are written by NCAR Command Language (version 6.4.0); the script with *.R is written by R language (version is given in the script); the script with *.m is written by MATLAB (version is given in the script).

All the inputs to run the codes are givens, and no other requirements are needed.
